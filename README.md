# BlinkIT-analysis
This project analyzes Blinkit’s sales performance, customer satisfaction, and outlet efficiency using MS Excel, SQL and Power BI.
The goal is to uncover insights and KPIs that can help improve product strategy, outlet performance, and overall profitability.

Tech Stack:
The dashboard was build using the following tools and technology:
a. SQL (MySQL) – for querying, data cleaning, and KPI calculation
b. Power BI – for creating interactive dashboards and visual analysis
c. Power query - data transformation and cleaning layer for reshasping and preparing data
d. DAX(data analysis expressions) - used for calculated measures
e. Microsoft Excel / CSV – for initial data handling

Data Source:
Dataset: Blinkit Sales Data – Kaggle

Project Features / Highlights:
1. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)-
Total Sales – Overall revenue generated from all items sold
Average Sales – Average revenue per transaction
Number of Items – Total items sold across outlets
Average Rating – Average customer rating for products

2. Business Analysis Using SQL:
Business Requirement	Objective	Chart Type (in Power BI)
a.	Total Sales by Fat Content	Analyze sales distribution by fat content type	Donut Chart
b.	Total Sales by Item Type	Identify best-performing product categories	Bar Chart
c.	Fat Content by Outlet for Total Sales	Compare sales across outlets segmented by fat content	Stacked Column Chart
d.	Total Sales by Outlet Establishment Year	Examine sales trends by outlet age	Line Chart
e.	Sales by Outlet Size	Understand relationship between outlet size and sales	Pie Chart
f.	Sales by Outlet Location Type	Visualize sales distribution geographically	Funnel Chart
g.	All Metrics by Outlet Type	Display all key KPIs (Sales, Rating, Items, etc.) by outlet	Matrix / KPI Cards

Features and Highlights:
1. Business Problem:
Blinkit, a quick-commerce retail company, faces challenges in understanding which factors most influence sales performance, customer satisfaction, and product efficiency across multiple outlets.
The lack of a unified, data-driven view makes it difficult for management to identify:
a. Which item types or fat content categories drive higher sales.
b. How outlet size, location, and establishment type impact performance.
c. Which areas need inventory optimization or strategic focus for revenue growth.
In short, the problem is the absence of actionable insights to support better sales forecasting, product placement, and operational efficiency decisions.

2. Goal of the Project and Dashboard
The primary goal of this Power BI dashboard is to analyze and visualize Blinkit’s sales, item performance, and customer satisfaction metrics to enable data-driven business decisions.
Key objectives include:
a. Understanding total and average sales trends across different product and outlet categories.
b. Evaluating the relationship between fat content, item type, and outlet attributes on total sales.
c. Identifying top-performing outlets and product types for targeted marketing or supply chain improvements.
d. Providing KPI-based monitoring (Total Sales, Average Sales, Number of Items, Average Rating) in an interactive format.

3. Key Visuals Walkthrough
The dashboard includes a set of interactive charts and KPIs designed for comprehensive business analysis:
a. Donut Chart – Total Sales by Fat Content
Shows how low-fat, regular, and other item categories contribute to total revenue, helping assess consumer preferences and health-based buying patterns.
b. Bar Chart – Total Sales by Item Type
Highlights which item categories (e.g., dairy, snacks, beverages) perform best in terms of sales volume.
c. Stacked Column Chart – Fat Content by Outlet for Total Sales
Compares sales distribution across different outlets segmented by fat content, revealing which outlet combinations perform best.
d. Line Chart – Total Sales by Outlet Establishment Year
Displays trends based on outlet age, helping identify whether older or newly established outlets perform better.
e. Pie/Donut Chart – Sales by Outlet Size
Analyzes how outlet size (Small, Medium, Large) correlates with sales, helping with space utilization and planning.
f. Funnel Map – Sales by Outlet Location
Presents the geographical spread of sales, making it easier to pinpoint high-performing regions.
g. Matrix Card – All Metrics by Outlet Type
Summarizes key metrics (Total Sales, Average Sales, Number of Items, Average Rating) across outlet types, giving a consolidated view of performance drivers.

4. Business Impact
Implementing this analysis allows Blinkit to:
a. Identify top-selling categories and profitable outlets, enabling better resource allocation.
b. Optimize inventory and supply chain by focusing on high-demand product segments.
c. Improve customer satisfaction through insights into rating patterns and sales preferences.
d. Support strategic decision-making with visual, real-time KPIs that replace static reports.
e. Increase operational efficiency by targeting underperforming outlets and adjusting product portfolios.

5. Key Insights
From the analysis, key observations include:
a. Regular fat content items generate the highest total sales, suggesting consumer preference for taste over low-fat options.
b. Certain item types (likely staples and beverages) dominate total sales, indicating where marketing focus should be placed.
c. Medium and large outlets outperform smaller ones, implying scale advantages.
d. Older outlets may have established customer bases but might lag in innovation compared to newer ones.
e. Specific geographic regions show higher sales concentration, guiding location-based promotional strategies.
